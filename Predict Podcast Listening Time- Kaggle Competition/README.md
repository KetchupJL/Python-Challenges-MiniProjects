# Predicting Podcast Listening Time with LightGBM
### *Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 4 (S5E4)*

This machine learning project tackles the prediction of podcast listening time using metadata such as genre, popularity, episode structure, and sentiment. As part of the Kaggle Playground Series (S5E4), the task involves structured tabular regression with a rich and noisy real-world dataset.

## Project Objectives
- Predict user **Listening Time (minutes)** from podcast episode features
- Apply **feature engineering** to encode user behaviour patterns
- Explore and compare **tree-based ML models** (LightGBM, Random Forest)
- Evaluate performance using RMSE and visual diagnostics
- Build a clean submission pipeline for Kaggle leaderboard evaluation

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Working with categorical and ordinal variables in LightGBM
- Feature engineering: binary flags, interactions, and density measures
- Model tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`
- Residual analysis and feature importance interpretation
- Submission-ready ML pipelines

## Tools & Technologies
| Category           | Tools Used                                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language**       | Python 3.10+                                                |
| **Modeling**       | LightGBM, RandomForestRegressor, XGBoost         |
| **Preprocessing**  | pandas, numpy, category handling, feature creation          |
| **Evaluation**     | scikit-learn (MAE, RMSE, R^2), matplotlib, seaborn          |
| **Notebook Type**  | Jupyter / Kaggle Notebooks                                  |

## Feature Engineering Highlights
- **Popularity Interaction**: Host Ã— Guest popularity
- **Ad Density**: Number of ads divided by episode length
- **Has Guest**: Binary flag for presence of a guest
- **Is Weekend / Is Evening**: Time-based behavioural flags
- **Sentiment Score**: Encoded episode sentiment
- **Length Bin**: Categorised episode duration

These features helped the model better capture listening behaviour nuances and temporal context.

## Final Model: Tuned LightGBM
- Trained on full dataset with engineered features
- Tuned via `RandomizedSearchCV` across 50 iterations
- Evaluated with cross-validation and residual diagnostics

### Final Leaderboard Submission
| Metric | Value    |
|--------|----------|
| RMSE   | **18.5** |
| MAE    | 13.8     |
| R^2    | 0.85+    |
